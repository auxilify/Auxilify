                <h1>How it works</h1>
                <p>Auxilify is the new way for you to get rid of your annoying online school work. You can do this by sending us your work so we can do it for you, in return for some money. Auxilify is currently in its early release so there are some limitations as to what work can be done by us.</p>
                
                <p>Here's some of the work we offer as of right now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IXL - Math & Language Arts</li>
                    <li>Math Nation - Algebra & Geometry</li>
                    <li>ALEKS - Math</li>
                    <li>Any other online school material websites can always be suggested</li>
                    <li>Any online assignments in general can always be suggested</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>There is currently a shortage of workers at Auxilify because of our early release. Due to this, we only directly offer to do work at freshmen level or lower (United States education system), for school subjects usually being math and language arts. Any other work will always be negotiable but would possibly have a somewhat larger chance of being rejected. You submit your work to us by emailing us details, where we then review the submission, discuss the details, and determine if we have a proper deal.</p>

                <h1>Policy</h1>
                <p>Auxilify runs on certain policies that both us and the customer need to follow:</p>
                <p>- Auxilify is not responsible if you get in any school or legal trouble from our service, our service has been said to be legally allowed, so legal problems would have a very minimal chance anyway.</p>
                <p>- Auxilify only accepts submissions with an offered price of what we charge for the work. If we don't directly charge anything for the given work, the price will be negotiated.</p>
                <p>- Auxilify has a blacklist policy, meaning we block you and revoke you from our service for any of the following conditions: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you fail to pay us owed money within 3 days.</li>
                    <li>If you are constantly sending us false submissions or spam.</li>
                    <li>If you create libel against us.</li>
                    <li>If you are suspected of scamming us.</li>
                    <li>If you impersonate us.</li>
                    <li>If you do anything to damage the corporation or any of our workers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>- Auxilify has a refund policy, this only happens for any of the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the given work graded happens to get graded below 90% of the goal grade, we will refund you 20% of how much you paid.</li>
                    <li>If the given work graded happens to get graded below 80% of the goal grade, we will refund you 100% of how much you paid.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To process a refund, you have to submit authentic proof of the assignment's grading within three days after the purchase.</p>
                <p>- Auxilify will only deny work submissions from customers if we are unable to do it due to lack of knowledge on the subject of work or if it is too risky to be done (such as some large/important tests or exams).</p>

                <h1>Payment</h1>
                <p>The cost for online assignments ranges based on the type of work and quantity. Since Auxilify is based on online transactions, there are two strict types of how you have to pay us:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50/50 Payment: You give us 50% of the total payment before we get the work done, then give the remaining 50% of the payment after we get the work done.</li>
                    <li>First pay, then work: You give us the total payment for your work before we get it done. This payment method is typically used for smaller transactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Auxilify does not tolerate scamming or money stealing of any sort. If there was a mistake with any money transactions, please <a href="#contact">Contact Us.</a></p>
                
                <p>As of right now, online payment methods are limited to PayPal, which we will provide you our PayPal information if we accept your work request. There is a chance of cash payment if you live in specific areas of the state of Florida. If you want to attempt cash payment, inform us the school you go to in your submission email, then we will let you know if you are eligible for cash payment. Cash payment transactions will take place at the given school where one of our workers will recieve the cash from you.</p>
